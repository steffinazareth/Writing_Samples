# Venmo

“Venmo me!” is a phrase almost everyone is familiar with in the US and understandably so. Compared to its competitors and even its parent company PayPal, Venmo has made peer-to-peer payments quicker and easier. 


With Venmo, all a user has to do once they have set up their bank account details is scan the other user’s ID or look up saved contacts, enter the amount to be paid, write a description for this amount and hit send! As simple as that. To make this process both faster and fun, the description can be as easy as an emoji for lightning perhaps to signify paying for the shared electricity bill or even an emoji for food to signify paying for the shared meal. It’s a language millennials are all too familiar with. It gets the message across without using any characters of the alphabet. 


With this, Venmo has definitely saved the user from the trouble of making themselves familiar with a payment process that is tedious and not as quick to follow each time a payment needs to be made to a colleague or friend for small everyday payments. Earlier it could have been the case that a long tedious payment process would put off a user having to pay his friend for his share of the meal. But with Venmo, the user could potentially look forward to paying his friend back for the meal perhaps even before they leave their seat at the restaurant - all in a matter of seconds!
